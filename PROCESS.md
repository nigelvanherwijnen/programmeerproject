# Process book

## Day 1 - 09/01/2017
On the first day, the first version of the concept plan had been made and the readme had been constructed.

## Day 2 - 10/01/2017
One of the problems in the first version of the concept plan was that a story was missing. This was partly because there were too many graphs on a single page. It was too chaotic. This is resolved by creating multiple pages. The homepage will be an eye catcher with the hockey stick graph and some general information. A second page will include a map showing CO2 emissions per country, a ranking of the countries of these emissions and a line graph visualizing the average temperature over the years of a specific country.
An additional page will focus on the relation between the emission of green house gasses and the welfare of a country. This page will include a bar chart viewing the GHG emission per GDP and a line graph containing two lines, one for the GDP over the years and one for the CO2 emission over the years.
The last page will include information on the way energy is produced. This means the focus of the total project will be on CO2 emission, the correlation with the welfare of a country and the way energy is produced. The visualization showing information on deforestation and urbanization will probably be left out.
